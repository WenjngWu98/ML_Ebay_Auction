# Final Project - INFO656 Wenjing Wu

## Introduction
In the past ten years, e-commerce has completely subverted our life. eBay is a popular second-hand trading platform with a daily trading volume of about 30,000 transactions. The second-hand luxury is a special category, which is purchased at a lower frequency and sold at a higher price per sale. 

The project aims to analyze the transactions of second-hand luxuries and predicting the best closing prices and bidding days of different items. The platform can display the results to users, giving them a better online experience. The data set contains the bidding days, opening price, closing price, eBay's feedback rating to bidders, and other information about each transaction. 

For sellers, the predicted bidding days and closing prices can help them adjust their setting, ensuring the success of selling in limited time. At the same time, the platform can also calculate the time node for sending promotion emails to customers according to the transaction features, so as to stimulate consumption without disturbing consumers too much. 

## Design Process
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Prediction model of recommended price
3. Prediction model of bid time
